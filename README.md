Data Pipeline for E-commerce Platform


Use Case Overview
This Terraform setup creates a data pipeline for an e-commerce platform. The pipeline integrates AWS S3, AWS Glue, and AWS Redshift to store, process, and analyze e-commerce transaction data.

Components
AWS S3: Stores raw e-commerce transaction data (CSV files).

AWS Glue: Extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data from S3 into Redshift.

AWS Redshift: Stores and analyzes the processed data for reporting.

Terraform Configuration
The Terraform configuration is organized into the following files:

provider.tf: Defines AWS as the provider.
variables.tf: Contains variable definitions for region, bucket names, database names, etc.
main.tf: Creates resources for S3, Glue, Redshift, and IAM roles/policies.
outputs.tf: Outputs resource information like the Redshift cluster endpoint and S3 bucket ARN.
